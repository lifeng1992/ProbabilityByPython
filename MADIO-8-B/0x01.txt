4000358 Recently I read a fine article by Prof. Walter Berns , called " The Core as an Education for Natural Aristocrats " ( see Academic Questions , Summer 1989 ) . It 's a Jeffersonian idea and I agree with it , but for some reason I find that I spend much more time worrying about that oxymoron , the natural bourgeoisie , than about any kind of aristocracy , natural or conventional . <p> It 's true that students at liberal arts colleges , even in Ohio , have a kind of aristocratic assurance that their lives will be successful , and that they will do important things in the world . Also , they tend to enjoy something of the high-minded innocence of the well-reared and protected which encourages them to love learning for its own sake rather than for material utility . But , to belabor the obvious , above all they are creatures of liberal democracy and , as such , irredeemably bourgeois . They pretend to be relativists but are really believers in rights and individual responsibility . Underneath the high-toned moralism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lives they will lead when they graduate will overwhelmingly be bourgeois lives , composed of the usual professional and commercial careers , condominiums , divorces , therapies , and retirements . <p> Of course , not only do liberal educators know this , but on the whole it drives them wild . As we all know , by and large liberal arts professors belong to that strain of the bourgeoisie which dislikes itself ; hence the really powerful intellectual movements on contemporary campuses are all characterized by bourgeois-bashing . What holds " humanistic , " i.e. , aesthetic , Nietzschean Marxism together is hatred of the human products of commercial republics . Feminism , which in the larger society has strong elements that are irreproachably bourgeois ( wages , equality , self-fulfillment ) , in the prestigious universities is magnetized to utopian , antibourgeois speculations about overcoming the " tyranny " of gender or " patriarchy . " Deconstruction , despite , and indeed because of its air of a political cool , mocks the square epistemological naivete of workaday life . The crusade against the dominance of " Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to something really exotic , and thus to destroy their bourgeois complacency . Pedagogical politics is thoroughly antibourgeois , whether it is engaged in purifying democracy of its bourgeois taint or creating idealists who are to work for a better nonbourgeois and perhaps nonliberal world . <p> Yet there is something paradoxical and self-defeating to the point of comedy in the way this all works out . To understand this , one has to remember why the bourgeois got such a bad reputation in the first place . This is not self-evident . In certain passages Adam Smith , for example , glorifies the honesty , straightforwardness and independence of the bourgeois . Where the courtly spaniel fawns and begs for a bone of patronage , the manly bourgeois plunks his hard-earned money down and " trucks " for his wherewithal . There are still some students like this , mostly economics majors , who simply can not be made to feel guilty about maximizing their utilities . Still , most of the students I see resemble the bourgeoisie Rousseau denounces and Moliere lampoons , a bourgeoisie intimidated by aristocratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bourgeois is a creature of cities , but not really a citizen , just a lover of private life , peace , and commerce . Alienated from his original human nature as a happy , sappy , witless beast , he has not achieved a coherent second nature . That is why " the natural bourgeoisie " is an oxymoron ; the bourgeois is convention incarnate . This makes him extremely nervous and he lives , like Moliere 's M. Jourdan , according to the opinions of others . His natural self-love sours into amour propre , poisoned by fears about his neighbors ' judgment of his lawn , his car , his politics , and his soul . The vice of vanity constitutes his inner life . He wants to be liked , even if not well-liked , if only someone will tell him what rules to conform to . In the end , most do not go as far as M. Jourdan ; most do not try to transform themselves utterly into aristocrats or -- as is more typical today -- proletarians or bohemians . But mostly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . <p> I find that students fit the pattern pretty well . The smugness which their teachers find so exasperating is only an attitude , struck for lack of a better , and easily gives way to self-contempt and cynicism . Last year I heard the actress Jody Foster , recently graduated from Yale , interviewed on a morning news show . The interviewer asked Ms. Foster if playing a rape victim in a film had enabled her to relive the real victim 's plight . Of course not , came the reply , to imagine that would just be " bourgeois . " I gather from this that Ms. Foster had learned her lessons well at Yale . She had learned that " bourgeois " is a synonym for philistine , fake , and vulgar . <p> But did learning this make her less bourgeois ? She may think so , but , to judge by the students I see , she would be wrong . Contempt for the bourgeoisie is in fact a classic and unattractive bourgeois trait that today 's liberal education tends merely to aggravate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently assumes the character of a pathological , " passive aggressive " relationship . On the surface , one parmer constantly exhorts , denounces , and edifies while the other heaps ashes on his head , confesses , and grovels . Really , however , the apparent victim , in this case the student , remains quite untouched , absorbs the critique into a preexisting pattern of self-blame and determination to resist , and often succeeds in revenging himself in typical passive aggressive ways by constantly offering hope of reform and constantly frustrating it . Real liberal education is thus twice blocked : first by the genuine , though hidden , resentment felt against what liberal education appears to be , and second by the students ' delusions that they have overcome their bourgeois limitations when they have merely intensified them . <p> Of course , the question Rousseau raises about the bourgeois is a version of the question we are treating here . There is indeed something defective about the bourgeois as a citizen , precisely because of his irony and anxiety , which are inextricably attached to his privatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bourgeois wavers between gestures of " commitment " and gestures of cynicism , between bursts of indignant enthusiasm ( for drugs today , against them tomorrow ) and retreats into passivity . The middle position between these gestures which , knowing themselves as gestures , are also done in bad faith , is a moderation essentially helpless , unguided by principle . Argument can lead nowhere : Should we interfere with other governments ? No . What about South Africa ? That 's different . Should we protect freedom of speech ? Yes . What about racist speech ? Well ... <p> It seems to me that ever since Rousseau there has been a great emerging argument in the West about how to ennoble and edify the bourgeoisie . Humanist Marxists , socialist communitarians , teachers of republican virtue , and even , though secretly I think , the overtly unedifying literary critics are all engaged in the task . Of course , as Allan Bloom has reminded us , liberal education always must balance against the prejudices of the regime , partly for the sake of the regime but mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not understand itself as essentially or primarily edifying . <p> Yet it seems to me that under current circumstances the argument between thought for its own sake and for political and moral edification is largely moot . This is because , as far as I can tell , all efforts at edification are failures on their own terms precisely because they are sensed , however dimly , as efforts at edification rather than real education . The contemporary version of anti-bourgeois moralizing fails with particularly comic aplomb because it plays right into those bourgeois traits it seeks to overcome . But the more serious nineteenth-century version , which had its roots in German classicism 's project of aesthetic education , failed as well . <p> Unlike contemporary moralism , which conceals itself as open-mindedness , the nineteenth-century version sought to combat mean-spirited anxiety directly . By holding heroic examples to the bourgeois for inspection and emulation , the bourgeois was supposed to become nobler , his vulgar tastes refined , his self-regarding passions generously extended . <p> In Schiller 's Don Carlos , written years before he developed the theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , we have the classic test case . The play 's apparent hero , the Marquis Posa , is a good eighteenth-century liberal set in despotic , unenlightened times . He is presented as both noble and democratic , a citizen of the world and a loving friend , a model to the high-minded young of the new , more egalitarian world . <p> But a careful reading of the play shows Posa to be a far more ambiguous character than his edifying appearance , a bad friend and an incompetent politician , motivated by vanity . The true greatness of the play depends on that more careful reading . Yet Schiller 's intent seems to have been to allow the edifying , moralizing reading to be generally accepted . The consequence was that the nobility of the example became unreal . Posa and other Schillerian heroes became hollow plaster casts of classical statuary which could be filled with any political content . Hence those horrible monographs one can still find in card catalogs on Schiller the Nationalist , Schiller the Socialist , Schiller the National Socialist . The ennobled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , understood it to be a gesture devoid of content . Hence , in part , the failure of high German culture to create a sufficiently responsible , politically decent bourgeoisie , a failure betokened in many old war movies by the figure of the sensitive , piano-playing German officer who still , justly , gets shot at the end . <p> The most edifying education that middle class Americans can receive , it seems to me , is the one that is the least overtly edifying , the least concerned to hector them or remake them , the one that is most concerned with setting out the matters of fact about themselves and the world . Trivial though this suggestion may appear , its implications may not be . <p> What would such an education look like ? It would share with the contemporary " diversity " movement the goal of letting students understand that their habitual customs and tastes are not simply natural but a product of prior choices that they must either affirm or reject . That means it would have to make available to them the Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Starting with a polemical animus against what the students presumably are , one teaches a wide variety of texts , taken out of the context of highly developed cultures , which are then made comprehensible by a hopelessly Western , if antibourgeois , analysis . The result is gesture and costume . Like those Nobel Hurons and Compassionate Pashas the eighteenth-century Enlightenment loved so dearly , the student sees the Other dressed in exotic garb , but he is really looking in the mirror and all he ever sees is himself . Thus he thinks he is learning " non-Western values , " when in fact it is only in a particular part of the West that faiths are thought of as " values . " Because he does not know himself he can not know the Other and thus can not know himself through the Other . Adding Fanon to the canon in no way rescues students from the grasp of Dead White European Males ; it merely adds a couple of outfits to the great historical fashion show to go with , say , the guitar of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The alternative would be to start with the West , not tormented by the bizarre dogma that everyone , from Aristotle to Augustine , was really just confirming the goodness of the American status quo . There students discover versions of the good , human types , which both distress and attract them : honor-loving warriors , contemplation-loving philosophers , God-fearing prophets and mystics , serious , warlike relativists , irrationalist scientists . They come to see for themselves what they are , what their lives are and generally will be like . As they reflect on their own responses to the arguments they are faced with , they come to understand the bourgeois not as a historical accident or , as Ms. Foster was taught , a social solecism , but as the product of a very serious choice that has its strengths and limitations . <p> On this basis , they can , if they are willing to expend the costs in time and energy , study a non-Western culture in a serious way , learning the language , taking its account of the good as seriously as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect it will be much easier in most cases to find the way to the samurai ideal from the Greek gentleman described by Aristotle than from the contemporary antibourgeois bourgeois prejudice which shudders at the very notion of rank , or to find the way to Asian religion from a serious study of Augustine than from the contemporary dogmas of those who understand religion only as a manifestation of " culture . " <p> On this basis , too , students can , I think , become better citizens of a liberal democracy . They learn how to escape from the plight of M. Jourdan , alternating helplessly between the attitudes of immense self-satisfaction and total anxiety . It is not that they are freed from irony about themselves . On the contrary , their irony will be far deeper because it will not have the phony salvation of progressive self-righteousness to offer it temporary and inadequate relief . They know much better than before just how far they are from what is truly excellent . But this knowledge , partly because it is knowledge , their knowledge , need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's own shortcomings is part of one 's life , one 's possession , and not a perpetual damnation by some unappeasable figure of authority . In those circumstances , it makes sense to try to change oneself from inside , to approximate standards that are not merely one 's own but which one has made one 's own , without regard to the opinions of others . <p> This is of course what those who sought to ennoble the bourgeoisie were after ; it is at the heart of the Kantian project that even now , in scientific disguise as Kohlbergian psychology , heavily influences the schools . But that end can not be held up as an ideal or hypostatized into a standard . If the end is already known , if we communicate , however subtly , that becoming more sensitive , or a more virtuous citizen , or a despiser of bourgeois vulgarity , or even an autonomous moral being is the goal of education , then that education degenerates into edification . Only if all the cards are put on the table can students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hot gospeling are constitutive of their bourgeois lives , emerge from the crippling irony and anxieties that are at root the same thing , whether they express themselves as cynicism or dogmatism . Only then can students become what they are , which is a necessary step to becoming something better than they are as citizens , as human beings , and yes , as members of the bourgeoisie . <p> <p> By Fred Baumann <p> <p> Fred Baumann is associate professor of political science at Kenyon College , Gambier , OH 43022 . <p>
